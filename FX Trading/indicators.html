            <h3>1. Trend Indicators</h3>
            <h4>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</h4>
            <P>This is the easiest moving
                average to construct. It is
                calculated as the average price
                over the specified period. The
                average is called “moving”
                because it is plotted on the
                chart bar by bar, forming a line
                that moves along the chart as
                the average value changes.</P>
           
            <p>• If the SMA is positively sloping, the trend is up. <br> <br>
                • If the SMA is negatively sloping, the trend is down.
                Determine trend duration <br> <br>
                • 200-bar SMAs are common proxies for long-term trends. <br> <br>
                • 50-bar SMAs are typically used to gauge intermediate trends. <br><br>
                • Shorter-period SMAs can be used to determine short-term trends.
                Determine trading signals via price crosses <br><br>
                • When prices cross above the SMA, you may want to go long
                or cover short. <br><br>
                • When prices cross below the SMA, you may want to go short
                or exit long</p>

            <P>Using moving average crossovers to generate trading signals

                When a more sensitive (faster) SMA crosses above a less sensitive (slower) SMA from below, it is considered bullish. 
                
                When a more sensitive (faster) SMA crosses below a less sensitive (slower) SMA from above, it is considered bearish.</P>

            <h4>Exponential
                Moving Average
                (EMA)</h4>
            
            <p>The EMA measures trend
                direction over a period of time.
                It applies more weight to data
                that is more current. Because of
                its unique calculation, EMA will
                follow prices more closely than
                a corresponding SMA</p>
           
      
                <p>• Use the same rules that apply to SMAs when interpreting EMAs.
            Keep in mind that EMAs are generally more sensitive to nearer-term
            price movement.
            Determine trend direction <br> <br>
            
            • When the EMA rises, you may want to consider buying when prices
            dip near or just below the EMA. When the EMA falls, you may
            consider selling when prices rally toward or just above the EMA.
            Indicate support and resistance areas <br> <br>
            
            • A rising EMA tends to support the price action, while a falling EMA
            tends to provide resistance to price action.</p> 
            <img src="./EMA.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Both the EMA and the SMA here represent 30 days.

                EMA reacts faster to the first pullback and the subsequent rally.</p>

            <h4>Moving Average
                Convergence/
                Divergence
                (MACD)</h4>
            
          
            <p>
            
                • MACD crossing above the zero line is considered bullish, while
                crossing below the zero line is bearish. When MACD turns up from
                below the zero line, it is considered bullish. When it turns down from
                above the zero line, it is considered bearish.
                <br> <br> 
                • When the MACD line crosses from below to above the signal line,
                the indicator is considered bullish. The further below the zero line
                this cross occurs, the stronger the signal.
                <br> <br>
                • When the MACD line crosses from above to below the signal line,
                the indicator is considered bearish. The further above the zero line
                this cross occurs, the stronger the signa

            <h3>2. Momentum Indicators </h3>
            <p>• In bounded indicators, also called “oscillators,”
                a limit exists as to how high or low they can reach.
                <br> <br>
                • When the oscillator reaches a zone close to its
                highest bound, it is called “overbought.”
                <br> <br>
                • When it reaches a zone close to its lowest bound,
                it is called “oversold.”
                <br> <br>
                • An oscillator value in these zones indicate that
                the market is vulnerable to reversal. A signal
                often occurs when the oscillator exits one of
                these zones
                <br> <br>
                • In some cases, the reaching of extreme levels
                indicates that a new trend has begun. In these
                instances, the oscillator will remain in a zone for
                the period of the trend and will give many false
                signals on corrections to the trend.
                <br> <br>
                • The interpretation of oscillator oversold
                and overbought is thus dependent on the
                underlying trend.
                <br> <br>
                • They don’t work when a trend is strong, but excel
                in trading range markets.</p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Stochastic Oscillator</h4>
                
                <p>Determine exit and entry
                    • Generally, the area above 80 indicates an overbought region, while
                    the area below 20 is considered an oversold region. <br> <br>

                    • A sell signal is given when the oscillator is above the 80 level and
                    then crosses back below 80. Conversely, a buy signal is given when
                    the oscillator is below 20 and then crosses back above 20.
                    <br> <br>
                    • A crossover signal occurs when the two lines cross in the overbought
                    or oversold region.
                    <br> <br>
                    • Divergences form when a new high or low in price is not confirmed
                    by the Stochastic Oscillator.
                </p> <hr>

                <h4>Relative Strength
                    Index (RSI)</h4>
              
                <p>Determine the speed and change of price
                    • The RSI oscillates from zero and 100. Traditionally, the RSI is
                    considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.
                    <br><br>
                    • In an uptrend or bull market, the RSI tends to remain in the 40-90
                    range with the 40-50 zone acting as support.
                    <br><br>
                    • During a downtrend or bear market, the RSI tends to stay in the
                    10-60 range with the 50-60 zone acting as resistance.
                    <br><br>
                    • If underlying prices make a new high or low that isn't confirmed by
                    the RSI, this divergence can signal a price reversal.</p>
                    <img src="./RSI.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Overbought and
                        oversold signals on the chart indicate price movement in the short term.
                    Also bullish divergence can be spotted</p>

            <h3>3.Volume Indicators </h3>
            <h4>General Volume Theory</h4>
            <P>ncreasing volume reinforces the
                trend direction.
                
                Declining volume diminishes the
                trend direction.
                
                A price peak or trough on ultrahigh
                volume is often an important reversal
                point in a trend.
                
                Volume indicators should be considered
                warnings but not signals of change in
                trend direction</P>
            <hr>
            <h4>On Balance
                Volume (OBV)</h4>
            
            <p>On Balance
                Volume (OBV)
                OBV measures buying and
                selling pressure as a cumulative
                indicator that adds volume on
                up days and subtracts volume
                on down days
                <br> <br>
                • The actual value of the OBV is unimportant; concentrate on its
                direction.
                <br> <br>
                • When price continues to make higher peaks and OBV fails to make
                higher peaks, the upward trend is likely to stall or fail. This is called a
                negative divergence.
                <br> <br>
                • When price continues to make lower troughs and OBV fails to make
                lower troughs, the downward trend is likely to stall or fail. This is
                called a positive divergence.</p>
                <img src="./OBV.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Bearish divergence:
                    OBV is confirming the higher peaks in price, which preceded the selloff</p>
                <hr>
            <h4>Money Flow Index</h4>
            
            <p> 
                MFI is a volume indicator that
                measures the flow of money
                into and out of a security over a
                specified period of time. It is
                related to the Relative Strength
                Index (RSI) but incorporates
                volume, whereas the RSI only
                considers price <br><br>
                • Oversold levels typically occur below 20 and overbought levels
                typically occur above 80. These levels may change depending on
                market conditions.
                <br><br>

                • Oversold or overbought levels are generally not reason enough to
                buy or sell and traders should consider additional technical analysis
                or research to confirm the security's turning point.
                <br><br>

                • If the underlying price makes a new high or low that isn't confirmed
                by the MFI, this divergence can signal a price reversal.
                                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>4. Volatility Indicators</h3>
                <h4>Bollinger Bands</h4>
                <p>Bollinger Bands are a type of
                    price envelope plotted at a
                    standard deviation level above
                    and below a Simple Moving
                    Average of the price. Bollinger
                    Bands help determine whether
                    prices are high or low on a
                    relative basis. <br> <br>
                
                    Determine relative price
                    • When the bands tighten during a period of low volatility, it raises the
                    likelihood of a sharp price move in either direction.
                    <br> <br>
                    • When the bands separate by an unusually large amount, volatility
                    increases and any existing trend may be ending.
                    <br> <br>
                    • Use swings within the band’s envelopes to help identify potential
                    profit targets</p>

                <p>Plot percentage retracement
                    lines based on the
                    mathematical relationship
                    within the Fibonacci sequence.
                    These retracement levels
                    provide support and resistance
                    levels that can be used to target
                    price objectives.

                    • Applying these percentages to the difference between the high and
                    low price for the period selected creates a set of price objectives.
                    <br> <br>
                    • Depending on the direction of the market, up or down, prices will
                    often retrace a significant portion of the previous trend before
                    resuming the move in the original direction.
                    <br> <br>
                    • These countertrend moves tend to fall into certain parameters, which
                    are often the Fibonacci Retracement levels.</p>
