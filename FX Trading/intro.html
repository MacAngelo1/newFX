<h2 class="heading-two"><i class="icon__globe"></i>What is Forex?</h2>
<p>Forex trading began in 1976 when the G7 decided to abandon the gold standard and dollar peg. The American
currency no longer determined the value of other currencies, and countries no longer needed to back
their money with gold. From that moment on, the value rate of any currency was determined by only two
parameters: supply and demand for it on the world market. And this market itself is called Forex, which
stands for foreign exchange.</p>


<ul>
<li>
<p class="mb-10 fw-600">Banks.</p>
<p>They act as so-called liquidity (or quotes) providers. Banks provide storage of currencies,
all transactions, and conversion from one currency to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="mb-10 fw-600">Traders.</p>
<p>These are active market participants. Forex traders are continually buying and selling
currencies, and other market assets while profiting from the differences among the buy/sell
prices.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p class="mb-10 fw-600">Brokers.</p>
<p>Since by law traders cannot personally participate directly in trades in the marketplace, an
intermediary is needed between him and the banks. Such an intermediary is, therefore, the
brokers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Because most money in the world is controlled by banks, banks constitute their own financial system. When a particular currency becomes more in demand (it is bought more), the rate for this currency in banks rises (it becomes more expensive). The trader (it could be anyone) buys this currency and sells it when it is at the peak of the price before its rate starts to fall. The trader's task is to predict the given price movement, and buy and sell at the right time. This is where having a winning Forex strategy comes in. And each trader should have his own strategy.</p>



<p class="mb-10 fw-600">We Reiterate:</p>
<p>The trader cannot buy and sell currency from the Forex market, so he uses the services of an intermediate brokerage company. Usually, a broker is by a governmental entity responsible for governing the ethical business operations of brokers. Brokers bring the trader's transactions to the interbank market and provide the trader with quotes, trading instruments, and other opportunities. In return, brokers take a commission from the trader's transactions. This is how Forex works.</p>

<h2 class="heading-two"><i class="icon__globe"></i>Forex education: The most effective
methods</h2>
<p class="mb-10">Forex for beginners is a conceptual apparatus. Several special terms are used in the
foreign exchange market, denoting market participants, price movements, specific events, and certain
actions or conditions. For example, there is the concept of <a data-tooltip="What is a Forex Spread and how does it Work?" href="/interesting-articles/what-forex-spread/">spread</a>. In the foreign exchange market, it
refers to the <span class="text-green">difference</span> between the buying price and the selling price.
</p>
<p>The point is that these two prices cannot be a priori equal because the seller and the buyer have
different goals. So the difference between these prices at a single instant in time is called the
spread. When <a data-tooltip="Trading without investment in Forex - Top 4 Options How to Make Money" href="/how-to-make-money-in-forex-without-investment/">starting Forex from scratch</a>,
it is essential to understand what a spread is
because it makes up the broker's commission as payment for services from each trader's transaction(s).
</p>
<div class="notice">
<i class="icon__info-blue"></i>
<div class="text">
<p class="mb-10 fw-600">Important notice</p>
<p>There is the chance to reduce the size of the spread on the Forex market. We are talking about a <a href="/forex-rebate/" data-tooltip="What is forex rebate? Earn more with Best Forex Cashback Rebate">rebate or spread</a> compensation, which every trader can get, regardless of his experience or the results of transactions. And it's free! <a data-tooltip="What is forex rebate?" href="/forex-rebate/">In this review</a>, we will tell you about rebates, how they work, what are the benefits of rebates for all participants in the scheme, how to register and
start getting a rebate, and much more. </p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="mb-10">There are other essential terms as well, such as bulls and bears. Of course, these are not
representatives of fauna. They are the nicknames given to the Forex market participants who implement
specific trading strategies. Bulls are traders who actively buy a particular currency (or other assets)
in anticipation of a rise. Thus, they make the quotes grow. Figuratively speaking, it’s like a bull
tossing the opponent up with its horns. Bears are traders who are waiting for a price decline, for
example, by entering into so-called <a href="/interesting-articles/what-is-short-selling/" data-tooltip="What is Short Selling? How to Use Shorts to Earn More?">short trades</a>. By their actions, they lower the quotes, again
figuratively, like a bear pressing its opponent to the ground with its paws.</p>
<p>There are many such exciting points and metaphors in the conceptual apparatus of a trader, but their
study does not take much time. And most importantly, there is no need to pay for the knowledge and
information. There are many <a data-tooltip="Forex Trading for Beginners: 15-minute Speed Course" href="/promo-5/">free Forex training programs</a> on the internet. </p>

<h2 class="heading-two"><i class="icon__globe"></i>How much money can you make on
Forex?</h2>
<p class="mb-10">Of course, the first thought that visits every novice trader is <a href="/how-much-can-you-earn/" data-tooltip="How Much Can You Make Trading in Forex">how much you can earn</a> on
Forex. A trader's earnings depend on many factors, including the Forex company (broker) through which he
enters the interbank market. In general, this is a highly volatile market, currency quotes are
constantly changing, and sometimes these changes are difficult to predict. But this is the job of a
trader.</p>
<p>As for direct earnings, in addition to brokerage commissions, the trader's strategy (for example,
scalping or intraday), the number of transactions that he conducts daily, the amount of his deposit, and
compliance with money management rules are essential. </p>
<div class="example">

<div class="text">
<p><span class="fw-600">For example</span>, according to the common rules, the value of one rate
should not exceed 2-5% of the deposit size. A larger bet is a direct violation of basic money
management rules, but this is how the Chinese trader Chen Likui managed to get 61,595% profit in
1 month!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="flex">
<div class="text">
<p class="mb-10">But Rejoice is an exception. Not in terms of earnings (you can immediately name
dozens of world-class traders with colossal incomes), but in terms of approach. In the vast
majority of cases, the winners act according to the basic rules of money management and within
the framework of standard market laws — because it is impossible to beat the market. <a data-tooltip="How Much Can You Make Trading in Forex in 2023?" href="/how-much-can-you-earn/">But it is possible to make money on its instability</a>.
</p>
<p class="mb-10">Top traders like Andy Krieger, with a deposit of several million dollars, with
leverage of 1:200 from ten transactions, may well receive up to 3-4 million dollars. But not the
average trader, which you will become in a few months after proper training. Small(er) deposits
(in the range of $100-500), of course, will reap less profit. So with ten trades a day and with
leverage of no more than 1:100, you can earn up to $300.</p>
<p>But you need to take into account that only 15-20% of novice traders become professionals. Why
does the majority fail? Because people do not want to spend the time learning, choosing a
reliable broker, and scrupulously thinking over their strategies. They want everything at
once. </p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading-two"><i class="icon__globe"></i>How to start from scratch at Forex
without investment </h2>
<p class="mb-10">After having completed an intensive
training course, and after choosing a broker, a future trader often understands that he is ready to
start trading, but is not ready to risk his own money just yet. The desire to try to make money or learn
from the real market without investment seems fantastic. Right? Right!</p>
<p>Currently, almost all Forex brokers offer their traders several unique opportunities that allow them <a data-tooltip="Trading without investment in Forex - Top 4 Options How to Make Money" href="/how-to-make-money-in-forex-without-investment/">to start trading without making a minimum deposit</a>. We have already mentioned these
opportunities. There are three of them: a demo account, a cent account, and a no-deposit trading
account. Now we will take a closer look at each of the options available to a novice trader.</p>
<ul>
<li>

<div class="text">
<p class="fw-600 mb-16">Forex demo account</p>
<p class="mb-16">These accounts are called <a href="/how-to-open-a-forex-demo-account/" data-tooltip="How to Open a Forex Demo Account for Free?">demo accounts</a> or just demo. The essence of the demo
account is in its name: it is created to demonstrate to the trader how everything works in
Forex using your broker’s trading platform. So, you enter the market through a real trading
terminal and open a completely real account. You get accurate quotes and up-to-date trading
instruments. For forecasts, you use real analytics, and you analyze the existing interbank
market.</p>
<p class="mb-16">The nuance of the demo account is that you are trading, but not for or using
real money. So your transactions never go to the interbank market: they simply rotate in a
virtual sandbox on your broker’s website. Consequently, you don't draw down any profits.
Likewise, the broker also does not risk anything and does not take any commissions from
you. </p>
<p class="mb-16">Usually, a trader is given 1000 virtual dollars (sometimes 5000), and as soon
as they run out, the demo account is closed. However, you can open a new one at any time.
Also, some brokers do not have a cash limit on these accounts but limit the time (usually 30
days) before they expire.</p>
<p>It is ideal for learning Forex as it provides a visual understanding of the foreign exchange
market and allows you to practice your first trading strategies and get to know your
broker’s training terminal and trading conditions.</p>
<div class="comparison">
<div class="pros">
<div class="pros-title">
<p>👍 Pros of demo accounts</p>

<div class="pros-list">
<p class="mb-10">• You don't need a deposit</p>
<p class="mb-10">• You work with real trading instruments and accurate quotes</p>
<p>• You can check any trading strategies</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cons">
<div class="cons-title">
<p>👎 Cons of demo accounts</p>

<div class="cons-list">
<p class="mb-10">• Lack of risk psychologically will not allow you to check the
objectivity of the individual </p>
<p>• A demo account's advantages are not particularly relevant after a few days of
intensive trading</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus, a demo account is more of a training session that includes practicing the technical
skills of interacting with the trading terminal, testing the basic strategy in "non-combat
conditions". But its importance cannot be overestimated.</p>

<li>

<div class="text">
<p class="fw-600 mb-16">Forex no-deposit account</p>
<p class="mb-16">As the name suggests, you do not need a deposit to enter the foreign exchange
market using this method. Unlike a demo account, this practice is not so widespread among
brokers. Still, savvy traders are increasingly finding this opportunity to open the first
full-fledged account without depositing their personal funds.</p>
<p class="mb-16">What then will you trade if you don't make a deposit? Answer: the broker's
money! The broker just gives the money to you sometimes as a gift and sometimes as a loan or
with strings attached. So you need to read the broker’s agreement regarding no-deposit
accounts carefully. Naturally, these are not colossal amounts, usually around $10.
But this kind of help is more than enough to start placing bets and earning your first
hundred dollars while gaining a unique practical experience along the way with “free” real
funds.</p>
<p>The Forex no-deposit bonus is the only limitation of the money that the broker will give you
upon registration. That is, you cannot withdraw the $10 (and often you cannot withdraw any
profits gained from it), and they will remain on your account indefinitely (or until you
lose them).</p>
<div class="comparison">
<div class="pros">
<div class="pros-title">
<p>👍 Pros of no-deposit Forex</p>

<div class="pros-list">
<p class="mb-10">• You don't need personal funds to start trading</p>
<p class="mb-10">• You don't risk your money.</p>
<p>• Using the broker's bonus deposit, you earn real money, which you can
subsequently withdraw</p>

<p>👎 Cons of no-deposit Forex</p>

<div class="cons-list">
<p>• If you lose the bonus deposit, the broker will not give you another </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Technically, a Forex no-deposit account has no real drawbacks, and you can start earning
professionally in the foreign exchange market without any investments at all. But if you are
lucky, it still makes sense to deposit a certain amount to increase the rates and,
accordingly, your income.</p>

<div class="text">
<p class="fw-600 mb-16">Forex cent accounts</p>
<p class="mb-16">Unlike Forex no-deposit and demo accounts, you are required to make an
investment when using a cent account, albeit in tiny monetary amounts, such as $1-10.</p>
<p class="mb-16">The idea behind a cent account is that you trade in the real market with real
money, but you place your bets not in dollars, but cents. Likewise, all your profit is
reduced by 100 times. But all risks are reduced by the same amount. A cent account allows
you to experience the Forex market and realize what it means to risk real money, not virtual
money, or the money provided by a broker. It’s a psychological thing. People trade
differently when using their “own” “real” money, no matter how small the amount. </p>
<p class="mb-16">Cent traders report that they quickly develop a “need for greed”! But this is a
trading trait that must be conquered and controlled for long-term growth and success. Better
to learn that lesson using $10 vs $10,000.</p>
<p>Cent accounts allow you to more conscientiously work out real strategies, and this is the
last step on the way to opening a real “dollar” account. Usually, novice traders open a demo
account first, and after a couple of days or weeks, they open a cent account. Some brokers
allow you to use the starting bonus on a cent account, but this is rare. A trader often
deposits something in the region of $1 into a cent account and trains for a week or two.
Thereafter, they migrate to a dollar (standard) account.</p>
<div class="comparison">
<div class="pros">
<div class="pros-title">
<p>👍 Benefits of a cent account</p>

<div class="pros-list">
<p class="mb-10">• Trading in the real market with real funds</p>
<p class="mb-10">• Unique practical experience</p>
<p>• Minimal risk (several tens of cents for the most unsuccessful bets)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cons">
<div class="cons-title">
<p>👎 Disadvantages of a cent account</p>

<div class="cons-list">
<p class="mb-10">• Insignificant profit </p>
<p>• Quickly becomes boring</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="mb-16">A cent account is ideal for self-studying Forex. But it gets boring in a snap
because the trader does not see significant profits or experience the “challenge” of risking
sizeable amounts of money. Typically, a cent account is traded for no more than one to two
weeks with active trading.</p>
<p>Novice traders do not always use all these opportunities. Some newbies, after a demo account,
immediately opens a dollar account. Some beginners who first work with a cent account,
believe that if there is not even a minimal risk, they will not be able to fully appreciate
the market's philosophy. It is all per the individual, but the result is the same: the
trader eventually opens a standard dollar account and begins his path to professional
trading and stable earnings. </p>

<h2 class="heading-two"><i class="icon__globe"></i>Self-trading or investing in Forex
</h2>
<p>Forex courses for beginners and training on demo and cent accounts provide an essential basis and
experience for newbie traders. But it does not answer the question: Is it more profitable to trade on
your own (i.e., do it yourself while assuming all the risks and mistakes), or is it better to minimize
the risk by choosing investments and letting experts manage your trades? </p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/dist/pages/forex-basics-from-a-to-z/img/img-4.svg" class="img-block" alt="Self-trading or investing in Forex">
<p class="fw-600 text-green mb-22" align="center">To make the right choice, let's start with the concept of
self-trading.</p>
<p>Independent Forex trading implies an independent analysis of the market, forecasting price movements for

That is, your profit is 100% dependent on you. No one helps you and you cannot shift responsibility to
anyone else. Likewise, you don’t have to share income or profits with anyone (excluding the broker's
commission). In short, the proverbial buck stops (and starts) with you, Mr. Boss.</p>

<p>In contrast, <a data-tooltip="How to Invest in Forex?" href="/how-to-invest/">investments are an alternative to independent trading</a>. Technically, investments can also be
called long-term trading (a type of Forex strategy), when orders remain open for many weeks and even
months. But now we will consider the traditional Forex investment methods that do not require
independent market analysis by you on a constant basis:</p>

<div class="icon"><i class="icon__check-mark"></i></div>
<div class="text">
<p class="mb-10 fw-600">PAMM accounts</p>
<p>With this investment option, a group of traders transfers part of their funds to a much
more experienced trader called a PAMM account manager. The account manager makes bets on
his behalf and, in addition to his funds, uses the funds invested by other traders. If
the bet wins, everyone gets a percentage based on the amount deposited, and the manager
takes a small commission from each bet. The “safety concept” (i.e., hedge against
losses) here is that the account manager is also investing his own funds so he is more
likely to exercise greater prudence and caution. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="icon"><i class="icon__check-mark"></i></div>
<div class="text">
<p class="mb-10 fw-600">LAMM accounts</p>
<p class="mb-10">In general, everything is the same as with PAMM accounts. That is, a more
professional market participant trades for you. The difference is that when investing in
PAMM, the funds transferred to the manager are reserved by the system but remain
digitally in your account. </p>
<p>In the case of LAMM, funds are not reserved, and the manager's bet is simply duplicated
to your trading terminal. But the result is the same: in case of a win, everyone gets a
legal profit, and the manager takes a percentage.</p>

<p class="mb-10 fw-600">Copying deals (auto trading or copy trading)</p>
<p>In this case, you carefully select a so-called signals provider—an experienced trader who
makes his bets and allows others to copy them. Depending on the broker’s conditions, <a data-tooltip="What is Forex Copy Trading and How to Use it?" href="/copy-trades/">full or partial copying</a> is possible. If the copied bet wins, the
signals provider again takes a small commission from your earnings.</p>

<p class="mb-10">All three investment options are popular and widely represented in the Forex market. New
options are constantly emerging (like RAMM), and they all provide great potential for passive income.
Independent trading also has its advantages: you gain personal experience, and your income depends only
on you. Or you can use all or some of the above methods at once if the broker’s conditions do not
prohibit it.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>Which one to choose? <a data-tooltip="How to Invest Money: Top 5 Forex Investment Options" href="/for-investors/">How to invest?</a> These can be million-dollar questions. Literally! Some
traders find it more convenient to trade independently; while others prefer to invest, saving them time,
headaches and worries. And some successfully combine these methods, complementing the profit with
independent trading by investing in — and learning from — others' experience. There is no ideal option,
and each trader decides for himself how it is more convenient for him to earn.</p>

<div class="question">
<p class="question-text">What are demo, cent, and no-deposit trading accounts?</p>
<p class="answer-text">On a demo account, you trade virtual money, on a cent you trade real
money but calculated in cents up to a limit of about $10. Hence, risk and profit are
minimal. A no-deposit Forex account does not require you to make a deposit using your own
money because the deposit is provided by the broker (usually no more than $10).</p>

<div class="question">
<p class="question-text">What will suit me better: self-trading or investing?</p>
<p class="answer-text">Many professional traders combine these two methods. In reality,
everything depends on your personal preference. Some traders prefer to make money
independently, while others find it more convenient to invest in PAMM accounts and receive
stable passive income while letting more experienced money managers carry the trading
burden.</p>
