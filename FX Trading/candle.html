         <h3>OHLC ?</h3>
         <P>
            What is OHLC? This term is always used by pro traders. OHLC stands for Open, High, Low and Close. The use of OHLC is to view and illustrate price movements in financial markets such as in forex as well as stocks. Each vertical line shows the open price, then the highest price then the lowest price and finally the closing price according to time or timeframe.
        So that brings us fully to candlesticks

            <h3>Hammer</h3>
            <p>
               <b> Structure and Identification </b> <br>

                A “hammer” is a candlestick with a small body (a small range from open to
                close), a long wick protruding below the body, and little to no wick above
                The wick must be atleast two times the length of the body
                It is usually found at the end or bottom of a downtrend or bearish Market <br> <br>

                <b>Implication</b> <br>
                When a hammer appears at the bottom of a downtrend, its long wick implies
                an unsuccessful effort by bears to push price down, and a corresponding
                effort by bulls to step in and push price back up quickly before the period
                closed. <br> <br>

                <b> How to trade </b> 
                    : A hammer signifies a potential bullish reversal 
                    Look for a hammer at the bottom of a downtrend, wait for the next candle formed after the candlestick to close above the high of the hammer that is a confirmation to go long 
                    A stoploss is  to be placed below the low of the hammer
                    Do not worry on what a stop loss is, that will be explained when we get to Technical analysis
            </p>

        <div>
            <img src="./Hanging Man.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                <b>Hanging Man</b> <br>

            The “hanging man” is the name given to a candle that is identical in shape
            to the hammer; the difference is that while hammers occur in downtrends,
            the hanging man pattern occurs at the top of uptrends.

            It is often the first sign that
            the uptrend is exhausting, and bears are stepping in to create a reversal.
            For the reversal signal to be confirmed, the consequent bearish bar should
            reach the “neckline” established by the open of the bullish bar on the
            other side of the hanging man
            </p>
        </div> <hr>
        <div>
            <img src="./Doji.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Doji</h3>
            <p>
            <b> Structure and Identification </b> <br>
            Looks like a Cross which is the star Doji candlestick
            A “long-legged doji” has long wicks in both directions, implying strong,
            balanced pressure from both buyers and sellers.
            This candle has zero or almost zero range between its open and close. <br> <br>

            <b> Ideology and Implication </b> <br>
            Rather than implying potential reversal or the clear dominance of either bears
            or bulls, these candles suggest indecision or balance between the two forces.
            Neither buyers nor sellers are fully in control. 

            A doji that occurs in the context
            of a strong trend implies the weakening of the dominant force that resulted in
            that trend. <br> <br>

            <b> How to trade </b> <br>
            Basically You stay out of the Market when you see this candle stick
            You can only trade when you see the Dragonfly or Gravestone doji
            </p>

                Dragonfly Doji
            </h3>
            <p>
               <b> Structure and Identification </b>
                Looks like a letter "T"
                The opening, highest and closing prices are the same
                Has no real body but long wick or shadow
                Found at a proceeding downtrend <br> <br>

                <b>Ideology and Implication </b>
                When the Market opens the bears drag the price all the way down 
                But the Bulls come in strongly and push price fully back to its opening level resulting in a long wick <br> <br>

                <b>How to trade </b> <br>
                Look for the Dragonfly Doji at the bottom of a downtrend 
                Wait for the next candle formed to close above the opening of the dragofly doji to confirm a Bullish strength
                Go long and place stop loss below the Dragonfly Doji

            <h3>Gravestone Doji </h3>
            <p>
                        <b> Structure and Identification</b> <br>
            Looks like an inverted letter "T"
            The opening, highest and closing prices are the same
            Has no real body but long wick or shadow above 
            Found at a proceeding upTrend <br> <br>

            <b>Ideology and Implication </b> <br>
            When the Market opens the bulls drag the price all the way up
            But the Bears come in strongly and push price fully back to its opening level resulting in a long wick<br> <br>

            <b>How to trade</b> <br>
            Look for the gravestone Doji at the top of an uptrend
            Wait for the next candle formed to close below the opening of the gravestone doji to confirm a Bearish strength and reversal
            Go short and place stop loss above the gravestone Doji

            <img src="./shooting.jpg" alt="shooting star">
            <h3>Shooting Star</h3>
            <p>
               <b> Structure and Identification </b> <br>
                This candlestick is simply the inversion of the hanging man and similar to the gravestone doji, only difference is, this has a body gravestone doesn't, it has a small
                body and a long wick protruding above it, with little to no wick below.
                The “shooting star” occurs at the height of an uptrend; <br> <br>

               <b> Implications</b> <br>
                its long wick implies
                that resistance to further bullish movement has been encountered above the
                close, and a bearish reversal may be imminent. <br> <br>

                <b> How to trade </b> <br>
                Look for a shooting star at the top of an uptrend
                Wait for the next candle formed to close below the low of the shooting star, This is a confirmation to go short
                Place stoploss above the Shooting star candlestick

               But both of them must have same low prices 
               Occurs at the bottom of a down Trend <br> <br>

               <b> Implications</b> <br>
               It shows a sudden switch over of Market force from the sellers to the buyers 
               The point of having the same lows could be regarded as a short term support 
                <br> <br>

                <b> How to trade </b> <br>
                Look for Tweezer bottom at the end of a down trend, Wait for the next candlestick to close above the high of two previous candlestick which indicates a strong bullish force

                <p>
                    A trader needs to know how to identify trends, your trading career is highly dependent on your ability to identify market trends, when the market is uptrend, when the market is downtrend or when the market moves sideways.  <br> <br>

                    <b> UP Trend</b> 
                    When the market is moving in an uptrend, the market will always make new higher highs and higher lows.  <br> <br>

                    <b> DOWN Trend</b>  
                    When the market is in a downtrend, the market will make new lows and higher lows. <br> <br>

                <p>
                    As seen in the photo, please read slowly to understand.. when the price of a market goes higher in price than it previously went.. That is called higher High, and Higher Highs will in most cases form a higher low that is when the current low is higher than the previous low <br> <br>
                    Aswell when the price of a market goes lower in price than it previously went.. The Tops are called Lower Highs and the bottoms are called Lower lows <br> <br>
                    <b>A Trendline</b> is line that touches 3 Or more Higher Lows or Lower Highs
